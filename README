# Haskell Stuff
Learning Haskell is painful and a complete waste of time... but I'm doing it anyway.

### Installation
Start by installing GHC (The compiler for Haskell) on your system. Refer to https://www.haskell.org/ghcup.

Then, you can either just `build` or `build & run` the application by executing the following scripts:
# To build & run:
sudo bash scripts/run
# To just build:
sudo bash scripts/build
